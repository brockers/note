# Makefile Usage Guide for Note CLI

This file explains how to use the Makefile for the `note` project.

## 🔨 Available Make Targets

### Building
make build          # Build the 'note' binary in current directory
make clean          # Remove build artifacts (note binary, go clean)

### Testing
make test           # Run unit tests (go test -v)
make integration-test    # Run integration tests (requires build first)
make test-all       # Run both unit and integration tests

### Code Quality
make fmt            # Format Go code (go fmt)
make vet            # Run Go vet for static analysis

### Installation
make install        # Install system-wide to /usr/local/bin (requires sudo)
make uninstall      # Remove from system (requires sudo)

### Development
make dev            # Build and show help (quick dev test)

## 📋 Common Workflows

### First Time Setup
# Build and test everything
make clean build test-all

# Try the application
make dev

### Development Cycle
# Make changes, then:
make fmt            # Format code
make vet            # Check for issues
make test           # Run unit tests
make build          # Build new binary
./note --help       # Test manually

### Before Committing
make test-all       # Run all tests
make fmt            # Format code

### Installation
# Install system-wide
sudo make install

# This will:
# 1. Copy 'note' to /usr/local/bin/
# 2. Install bash completions to /etc/bash_completion.d/
# 3. Make it available in your PATH

# To remove later:
sudo make uninstall

## 💡 Tips

- No arguments: Just run `make` - it defaults to `make build`
- Parallel jobs: Use `make -j4` for faster builds (though not much benefit here)
- Verbose output: Most targets already include verbose flags
- Dependencies: Targets automatically handle dependencies (e.g., `integration-test` runs `build` first)

## 🔧 Target Dependencies

build           -> (no dependencies)
test            -> (no dependencies)  
integration-test -> build
test-all        -> test, integration-test
install         -> build
dev             -> build
clean           -> (no dependencies)
fmt             -> (no dependencies)
vet             -> (no dependencies)

The Makefile automates all common development tasks while following Go and Unix conventions!
