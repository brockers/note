# PRD Folder Structure

New PLANNING Requirements Document (PRD) go here to be executed. They are initially created by running prp-plan.md 

## Templates

The directory also contains a `templates\` folder that has the default out line for the PRDs.  These should NOT be language specific as we want the planning document to be funcationality specific and not technology specific.  That said, additional templates can be added for specific research planning needs.
