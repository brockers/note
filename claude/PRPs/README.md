# PRP Folder Structure

New Product Requirement Prompts (PRP) base go here to be executed.  They are generally generated by a prp-execute command.  The resulting files can be used by the corresponding prp-execute command to build a feature.

## Templates

The directory also contains a `templates\` folder that has the default out line for the PRPs for specific programming languages. (i.e. Typescript, Java, C#, etc.)  They should match up with a specific create/execute Claude command based on the language being used.

### Existing Template Types

* prp_base_typescript - Typescript PRP for use with prp-create-ts.md and prp-execute-ts.md
