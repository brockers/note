# Release Notes

## 🎉 Version 0.1.5 - First Official Release

**Release Date:** January 12, 2026
**Build Date:** 2026-01-12_19:45:07UTC
**Commit SHA:** 5a123d0

This marks the **first official release** of `note` - a minimalist command-line note-taking tool that embraces the Unix philosophy: do one thing well and compose with other tools.

---

## 📦 What is `note`?

`note` is a minimalist, opinionated command-line tool designed for developers, sysadmins, and anyone who lives in the terminal and wants frictionless note-taking without leaving their workflow.

### Core Philosophy

- **No databases** - Just markdown files in folders
- **No sync built-in** - Use git, Dropbox, or any sync tool you prefer
- **No tags or categories** - Use your filesystem and grep
- **No dependencies** - Single static binary written in Go
- **No lock-in** - Your notes are just text files

---

## ✨ Key Features

### 🎯 Automatic Date Stamping
Every note automatically gets `-YYYYMMDD` appended to its filename, creating a chronological archive of your thoughts without any manual effort.

```bash
note meeting            # Creates meeting-20260112.md
note project-ideas      # Creates project-ideas-20260112.md
```

### ⚡ Two-Question Setup
No complex configuration files or endless options. Just two questions:
1. What's your preferred text editor?
2. Where do you want to save your notes?

Done. You're ready to take notes.

### 🔍 Smart Search & Listing
Find your notes quickly with built-in search:

```bash
note -l                 # List all current notes
note -l project         # List notes containing "project"
note -s "todo"          # Full-text search across all notes
note -as "idea"         # Search including archived notes
```

### 📁 Archive System (Never Delete)
Notes are precious. `note` never deletes - it archives:

```bash
note -d old-*           # Archive notes starting with "old-"
note -a                 # List all notes including archived
note -al meeting        # List all meeting notes, even archived ones
```

### ⌨️ Tab Completion
Bash, Zsh, and Fish shell completions make finding and opening notes as fast as typing a few characters and hitting TAB.

```bash
note Life<TAB><TAB>     # Shows all notes starting with "Life"
```

### 🔗 Flag Chaining
Combine flags for powerful operations:

```bash
note -al project        # List all project notes (including archived)
note -as "bug"          # Search all notes for "bug" (including archived)
```

### 📝 Universal Markdown Format
All notes are saved as plain markdown files. Use any editor, sync with any service, read on any device. Your notes will outlive any app.

### 🚀 Shell Aliases
Optional convenient aliases for common operations:

```bash
n meeting               # Same as 'note meeting'
nls project             # Same as 'note -l project'
nrm old-*               # Same as 'note -d old-*'
```
